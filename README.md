PRED_PREY_IMSP_IMSP1 is a collection of MATLAB routines using the finite difference/finite element method for simulating the dynamics of predator-prey interactions in 1D and 2D. The routines are based on first order Implicit-Symplectic Schemes. The MATLAB code is mostly self explanatory, with the names of variables and parameters corresponding to the symbols used in the finite element / difference methods described in the papers referenced below.
